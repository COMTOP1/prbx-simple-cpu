= PRBX SimpleCPU Instruction Set Simulator

This project is to implement the mjf5.011 project at the University of York.

The SimpleCPU ISS is a teaching tool designed to help students (or anyone) who is struggling to understand how CPU execute instructions.
Anyone could learn what an instruction does when manually calculating something but how does a CPU interpret that.
